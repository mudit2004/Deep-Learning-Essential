# Deep-Learning-Essential

This repository is dedicated to essential deep learning experiments and implementations. The goal is to provide a comprehensive guide and reference for various deep learning tasks using different architectures and techniques.

## List of Experiments

1. **Train a deep neural network for an image classification task.**
2. **Apply convolutional neural network for the same image classification dataset and compare DNN and CNN in terms of parameters and performance.**
3. **Construct an object detector using a convolutional neural network.**
4. **Develop an image segmentation model using a fully convolutional network.**
5. **Demonstrate the use of an autoencoder for dimensionality reduction.**
6. **Train a convolutional autoencoder for image reconstruction.**
7. **Apply a denoising autoencoder for noise removal and obtain clean images.**
8. **Implement image captioning using a recurrent neural network.**
9. **Design an LSTM-based handwriting recognition model.**
10. **Compare the performance of RNN, LSTM, and GRU in the prediction of time series data.**
11. **Train a generative adversarial network with a sample image dataset and analyze the generated images.**
12. **Implement a deep reinforcement learning algorithm for dynamic prediction.**
